# clavenar-ctl — operator CLI (binary: `clavenarctl`), thin client over `clavenar-sdk`

The crate/repo is `clavenar-ctl`; the shipped binary is `clavenarctl`
(kubectl pattern). Every subcommand calls into a `clavenar-sdk` client —
the SDK is the typed library, this is the human-facing CLI.

## Build, test, lint

```bash
cargo build                                # release: cargo build --release
cargo test                                 # integration tests spawn the binary via assert_cmd
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # the floor — no #[allow] to silence
cargo deny check all                       # supply-chain gate, run host-side
cargo cyclonedx --format json --describe crate   # SBOM
```

Host caveat: this repo's `target/` may be root-owned from prior docker
builds — build on the host with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/clavenar-ctl-target`.

Sibling inputs: this crate is **not** in a Cargo workspace. It depends on
`../clavenar-sdk` and `../clavenar-chaos-catalog` by path, `include_str!`s Rego
templates from `../clavenar-policy-engine/policies/templates/` (the
`generate-policy` starter pack), and `include_str!`s
`../clavenar-lite/policies/governance.rego` (the `init --guard` starter
policy). CI derives all four from Cargo manifests and literal Rust include
paths with the SHA-256-checked assembler snapshot pinned to its recorded
`clavenar-e2e` source commit; do not restore a hand-maintained clone list.

Run: `clavenarctl <verb>` (e.g. `clavenarctl doctor`, `clavenarctl agents list
--tenant <T>`). No listener — it's a client; it talks to identity (`:8086`),
ledger (`:8083`), and hil (`:8084`) over HTTP/HTTPS, and the proxy over mTLS.
After `cargo install --path .` the binary lands as `~/.cargo/bin/clavenarctl`.

## Layout
- `src/main.rs` — entrypoint. `Cli` / `Command` clap-derive tree, global
  `--identity-url`, and the `ExitCode` mapping.
- `src/cmd/` — one module per verb, each exporting an `Args` struct + `run()`
  returning `ExitCode`. Top-level verbs (11): `init`, `doctor`,
  `generate-policy` (template emitter, `policy.rs`), `policy` (Policy Lab,
  `policy_lab.rs`), `auth`, `agents`, `pending`, `regulatory`, `assurance`,
  `mcp-bridge`, `import-provider-audit`. Supporting modules:
  `import_scanner`, `import_workloads`, `migrate`, `bootstrap`,
  `agents_certify`, and the `policy_*` Exchange/install/library/lab/scaffold
  helpers. `agents` = full lifecycle read+write
  (create/suspend/unsuspend/decommission/envelope/transfer/description) +
  bulk import (`migrate`, `import-from-scanner|workloads`, `bootstrap`) +
  `certify`.
- `src/config.rs` — `config.toml` parse + flag→env→file→default resolution.
- `src/credentials.rs` — per-tenant OIDC `id_token` cache.
- `tests/cli_integration.rs` — `assert_cmd` exit-code / stdout contract.
- `docs/SEQUENCES.md` — sequence diagrams for the primary subcommands.
- `docs/clients/` — per-MCP-client `mcp-bridge` setup recipes.
- `deny.toml` — supply-chain policy (advisories / licenses / bans / sources).

## Conventions & invariants

- **Formatting is an owning-CI gate.** Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  before pushing Rust changes; CI runs it before check, test, and clippy.
- After adding or updating a feature, also update the relevant `MANUAL_TESTS*` file(s) when needed.
- **Exit codes are a wire contract** (spec §9.3), deterministic and
  machine-checkable: `0` success · `2` validation (bad args, 400/404/422) ·
  `3` auth/capability (401/403) · `4` conflict (409, already-in-desired-state) ·
  `5` server (5xx, transport, decode). CI treats `4` as "continue", other
  non-zero as "fail loudly". Don't repurpose these.
- **Config resolution, highest first:** per-call flag → env var
  (`CLAVENAR_IDENTITY_URL` / `CLAVENAR_TENANT` / `CLAVENAR_LEDGER_URL`) →
  `config.toml` (next to the credentials file) → built-in default
  (`identity_url` = `http://localhost:8086`). No default tenant — missing
  fails loudly.
- **Credentials file is mode `0600` on Unix**, opened atomically with that
  mode on create (ACL-restricted on Windows). Path follows the `directories`
  crate `config_dir()` (`~/.config/clavenar/credentials.json` on Linux).
  Tests/e2e override with `CLAVENAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH` — never touch the
  operator's real file from a test.
- **`auth whoami` decodes JWT claims without verifying the signature** —
  display only. Server-side validation on every request stays authoritative.
- **`pending decide <token>` token is a pointer + action claim, never a
  credential.** Deciding still requires the operator's own standing
  authority: an mTLS client cert in HIL's allowlist plus the decide-token
  bearer (`CLAVENAR_HIL_DECIDE_TOKEN` / `--decide-token`). `--as` stamps the
  operator into the chain; rows are marked `decided_via=terminal`. Nothing is
  decided without `--yes`.
- **`generate-policy` templates are embedded at build time** via
  `include_str!` from the policy-engine sibling — no runtime FS dependency,
  but the sibling must be present at compile time (hence the CI clone).
- **`agents certify` exits non-zero writing nothing** if any chaos probe
  reaches the candidate; it proves the enforcement boundary held for the
  asserted `--sdk-version`, not that agent code is correct.

Rust house rules:
- clippy `-D warnings` is the floor; fix the code, don't `#[allow]` (only for
  a documented false positive, with the reason in the attribute). This crate
  also sets `unreachable_pub = "warn"` — keep visibility tight; use
  `pub(crate)` for module-internal items. One standing exception:
  `policy_lab.rs` carries an un-reasoned `#[allow(dead_code)]` stub that
  keeps its `BTreeMap` import used — remove stub, allow, and import
  together or not at all.
- A type in a `pub` fn signature must itself be `pub` (`private_interfaces`).
- Tests at file bottom in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` (after all other items).
- `writeln!` over `write!(…, "…\n")`; prefer let-chains over nested `if let`.
- Doc comments: no `+ ` line-start continuations (clippy reads them as
  misindented list items).
- `deny.toml` is synced verbatim from `clavenar-specs` — edit it there
  first, then mirror the exact bytes.
- Commit subjects must start with a lowercase letter.
